# Signal Collapse Recovery – Emergency Field Shutdown & Energy Damping

## ⚠️ Purpose

The **Signal Collapse Recovery (SCR)** module handles:

- Field overload  
- Harmonic phase error > threshold  
- EM feedback loops  
- Structural lens damage  
- Unexpected resonance cascade

It prevents uncontrolled output behaviors via **safe contraction and dumping of excess field energy**.

## 🧠 Trigger Conditions

```python
if ΔΦ(t) > 1.5 rad in <10 ms:
    activate SCR()
elif TSA reports curvature_shift > 2.5°:
    engage beam damping
elif field_damper loss exceeds 3.2 dB/m:
    trigger mode fallback
```

## 🔁 Collapse Process

1. **Immediate lens aperture contraction**  
   - Morph to Gaussian fade mode via `/field_projection_lens.md`  
2. **Tri-beam decoupling (if in Tesla 3-6-9 mode)**  
3. **Harmonic field siphoning** into energy sink loop  
   - Re-routed to dedicated thermal resistor array  
4. **Redundant coil dumping**  
   - Cross-circuit to bifilar grounding coils  
5. **Cooldown lockout enforced for 2.5 sec**

## 🛡️ Anomaly Shielding (Optional Mode)

When SCR engages, a secondary EM shell can be deployed:

- Geometry: Toroidal inverse  
- Power drain: 8–12W sustained  
- Shield longevity: ~750 ms  
- Purpose: Isolate ambient sensors and memory systems from EM overspill

## 🔗 System Hooks

- Accepts signal from `/telemetry_scope_array.md`  
- Commands shape transition in `/field_projection_lens.md`  
- Sends pulse-stop signal to `/output_characteristics.md`  
- Logs events to `/drift_log_visualizer.md`

---

## 🧬 Notes

- SCR is **non-destructive**: all components recover post-cycle  
- Activates in **<4 ms** from trip condition  
- System reboot via external command only — no auto-resume
