# Signal Collapse Recovery – Injection Stabilization Protocol

## 💥 Problem

Under extreme conditions — such as resonance overshoot, pulse skipping, or curvature inversion — the injected G1 waveform may experience:

- **Field discontinuity**  
- **Phase jitter accumulation**  
- **Node vector fragmentation**  
- **Collapse of coherence envelope**

This document defines the exact protocol used by the system to **detect**, **interrupt**, and **recover** from such failures in real time.

## 📉 Collapse Detection Criteria

```pseudocode
if PHASE_Δ(t) > 0.17 rad for >2.5ms:
    trigger collapse handler

if S1_VECTOR_ANGLE drift > 3.0° within 4 cycles:
    flag field instability

if ∂²(curvature)/∂t² shows non-monotonic spike:
    assume coherence rupture
```

Each of these triggers will initiate the **SCR (Signal Collapse Recovery)** routine.

## 🔁 Recovery Protocol Overview

1. **Freeze Injection:**  
   Immediately halt further waveform output

2. **Dump Residual Charge:**  
   Route residual waveform energy to internal ring buffer capacitor (C_R1) or dummy load

3. **Initiate Recovery Pulse Sequence:**  
   Inject timed **damped sine pulses** at descending amplitude across 3-6-9 sequence

```math
V_recover(t) = A₀·e^(–β·t)·sin(2π·f·t)
```

Where:
- \( β \) = damping coefficient (adaptive)
- \( f \) = 3Hz, 6Hz, or 9Hz (in sequence)

4. **Re-establish Phase Lock:**  
   Use T1 timing to re-zero phase reference before resuming injections

5. **Resume Output with SR_2 waveform profile (stabilizer)**

## 🧮 Adaptive Damping Logic

The system estimates collapse severity and tunes damping like so:

```pseudocode
if collapse_time < 2ms:
    β = 0.3 (fast damping)

if collapse_time ≥ 2ms and < 5ms:
    β = 0.1

if collapse_time ≥ 5ms:
    β = 0.05 (slow taper)
```

---

## 🔐 Fail-Safe Conditions

If recovery fails after 3 attempts:

- Lockout G1 for 5s  
- Trigger full-system curvature resync  
- Log all signal traces to NVRAM for post-analysis

---

## 🧪 Testing Procedure

- Artificially inject phase noise into T1  
- Log waveform deviation and recovery success  
- Validate phase re-lock occurs within 8ms post-recovery

---

## 🧬 Integration Notes

- Works in tandem with `/dynamic_resonance_mapper.md`  
- Requires access to G1 injection timing bus and S1 vector feedback  
- Optionally uses `/safety_interlock_matrix.md` to veto high-risk reinjection timing
