# Signal Collapse Recovery ‚Äì Harmonic Disruption Response & System Reboot Logic

## üí• Context

In high-energy, phase-sensitive systems, the possibility of **signal collapse** is real:

- Harmonic dissonance  
- Unexpected environmental resonance  
- Phase loop instability  
- Recursive feedback overload  

When these events occur, we don‚Äôt shut down. We **reboot the field**.

---

## üß† Recovery Logic Overview

The system initiates a **multi-tiered fallback protocol** when collapse conditions are met.

### Collapse Detection Criteria:

- Beam phase coherence drops > 40%  
- Feedback loops form closed oscillation > 500ms  
- Telemetry Scope Array reports null curvature vector  
- Output amplitude exceeds safe bounds

## ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

| Time (ms) | Action                         |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| 0         | Collapse trigger initiated     |
| <5        | GVC loop halt + T1 freeze      |
| 5‚Äì20      | Phase memory snapshot taken    |
| 20‚Äì50     | Output field dump via EVCA port|
| 50‚Äì80     | Secondary waveform initiated   |
| 80‚Äì100    | T1 phase rebias engaged        |
| 100‚Äì150   | GVC rebooted with adjusted seed|
| >150      | Field re-stabilization verified|

## üîã EVCA Port Dump

The **Emergency Vector Curvature Aperture (EVCA)** is a passive vent shunt that discharges stored harmonic potential into a grounded toroid matrix:

- Bismuth-core ring  
- Coated in ferrite dampers  
- Connected to thermal bleed sink

This prevents harmonic backfire or internal node burnout.

---

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Phase Memory Buffer

Before collapse resets the system, a **snapshot of current harmonic topology** is taken:

- Vector map  
- Phase angle deltas  
- Loop integrals  
- T1 position vectors

This allows for near-identical reboot to prior state post-recovery.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Failsafes

- **Secondary signal jam gate** activates during collapse to prevent rebound oscillation  
- All power injection is paused mid-reboot  
- Post-recovery emissions limited to 80% amplitude until verified stable

---

## üß¨ Integration

- Triggered via TSA anomalies from `/telemetry_scope_array.md`  
- Phase rebias executed by `/gyroscopic_feedback_t1.md`  
- Reboots into `/dynamic_resonance_mapper.md` corrected path set  
- Logs timestamped in `/anomaly_logbook.md`
