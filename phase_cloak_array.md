# Subsystem S1 – Phase Cloak Array

## 🧠 Objective

The `S1` subsystem, also known as the **Phase Cloak Array**, is responsible for enabling passive observation of the rotating field core without triggering decoherence, collapse, or interference with the Gödelian harmonic state.

Unlike traditional sensor rings, the Phase Cloak Array uses **resonant field reflection** and **phase harmonic lock-in** to **map curvature indirectly**, avoiding waveform extraction or charge transfer.

---

## 🪞 Operating Principle

The Phase Cloak functions as a **non-mechanical, non-invasive field mirror system**, structured to passively reflect and reshape harmonic phase signatures from the rotating field environment.

It uses **Tesla coil triplets** arranged in a **circular trinary array**, shielded from direct current and tuned to reflect **only 3-6-9 harmonic modes**.

The reflected signal is routed to the `T1` Telemetry Tap (via phase-comparator buffer), enabling indirect observation of field dynamics without collapse.

```

All S1 nodes face **inward**, centered on the `R1` rotational core. Coils are **tuned but floating** — never grounded — to preserve harmonic reflection integrity.

## 🛡️ Anti-Interference Methodology

The Phase Cloak uses **harmonic mirror logic**, not active detection:

- No electrical probe or EM sampling  
- No voltage differential across coils  
- Only reflected standing wave patterns are captured  
- Core field **never interacts with shielded circuitry directly**  
- T1 reads **only the phase delta**, not the raw waveform

This architecture preserves the harmonic coherence necessary for Gödelian loop stability.

## 🧮 Mathematical Context

Reflected signal captured via:

```math
R(\phi, t) = A \cdot \cos(3\omega t + \phi) + B \cdot \cos(6\omega t + \phi) + C \cdot \cos(9\omega t + \phi)
```

Where:
- \( A, B, C \) are resonance match coefficients  
- \( \phi \) is coil phase angle  
- No direct field term is sampled

Output delta (to `T1`) computed via:

```math
\Delta R(t) = R_{\text{ref}}(t) - R_{\text{env}}(t + \delta t)
```

Ensuring signal is **reflective only**.

## 🛠️ Real-World Parts List

- Tesla-style passive coil windings (12x)
- Shield backing (99.9% copper alloy or silver composite)
- Dielectric ring base (non-magnetic)
- Teflon-insulated signal lines to T1  
- Optional: RF choke guards to eliminate crosstalk across the array

## 🔗 Output Flow

```

This chain ensures **total field isolation**, while still feeding usable phase delta into G1’s feedback loop.
