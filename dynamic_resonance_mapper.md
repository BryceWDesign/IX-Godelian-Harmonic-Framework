# Dynamic Resonance Mapper (DRM) – Curvature Feedback Engine

## 🧠 Purpose

The Dynamic Resonance Mapper (`DRM`) serves as a **real-time mapping engine** that adjusts G1 waveform profiles based on:

- Current curvature of the local field  
- Phase deviation over time  
- Angular misalignment of output vectors (S1)  
- Subharmonic echo feedback from failed injections

This allows the IX-Godelian-Harmonic-Framework to **self-correct** against environmental drift and internal instability.

## 📊 Input Sources

| Source | Input Metric              | Resolution         | Update Interval |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| T1     | `CURVATURE_Δ`, `PHASE_Δ`  | 0.01°, 0.001 rad   | Every 9Hz cycle |
| S1     | `S1_VECTOR_ANGLE`         | 0.05°              | Continuous      |
| G1     | `LAST_WAVEFORM_ID`        | Binary ID + error  | Per injection   |

## 📈 Output Function

The DRM dynamically selects a G1 waveform profile from the pre-defined waveform bank:

```text
Waveform Bank = { RL_0, RL_1, CE_0, CN_1, SR_2, FR_0, FR_1 }
```

Each waveform is tagged with:
- Base amplitude (A)  
- Injection envelope shape (E)  
- Harmonic tuning mode (n ∈ {3,6,9})  
- Phase lock window (Δφ tolerance)

## 🧮 Selection Logic

```pseudocode
if CURVATURE_Δ > 3.0 and CURVATURE_Δ < 6.5:
    use CE_0 if PHASE_Δ < 0.1 else use CE_1

if CURVATURE_Δ ≥ 6.5:
    if S1_VECTOR_ANGLE drift > 2.0°:
        use CN_1
    else:
        use CN_0

if PHASE_Δ drifts > 0.05 for 3 cycles:
    enter SR_2 fallback

if waveform failed to stabilize:
    use FR_0 after 1 cycle delay
```

All selected waveforms are passed through the HIC for injection authorization.

## 📡 Adaptive Envelope Tuning

DRM modulates the waveform envelope in real-time:

```math
E(t) = A · sin(2π·f_n·t) · e^(–α·t)
```

Where:
- \( A \) is amplitude from waveform bank  
- \( f_n \) is harmonic frequency (3 Hz, 6 Hz, or 9 Hz)  
- \( α \) is decay constant tuned per field damping ratio

This creates a **self-dampening correction pulse** aligned with Gödelian trajectory.

## 🛠️ Hardware Notes

- Implement DRM as part of G1’s internal controller firmware  
- Use lookup tables (LUTs) for waveform parameters  
- Synchronize with HS-BUS to ensure phase-locked injection  
- Optional: Buffer waveform into RAM ring for trace replay

---

## 🧪 Testing Methods

- Inject known curvature anomalies and log selected waveforms  
- Use synthetic drift to validate SR_2 fallback triggering  
- Cross-check selected waveform against target field recovery rate

## 🧬 Functional Example

```text
[T1] CURVATURE_Δ: 7.2°
[T1] PHASE_Δ: 0.06 rad
[S1] VECTOR_ANGLE drift: 2.3°

→ DRM selects CN_1
→ Passes to HIC
→ Injection scheduled at next T_sync window
```
