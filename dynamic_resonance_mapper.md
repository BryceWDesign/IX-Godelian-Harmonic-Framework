# Dynamic Resonance Mapper – Real-Time Field Convergence Controller

## 🎯 Purpose

The **Dynamic Resonance Mapper (DRM)** is the core system responsible for guiding harmonic field curvature through 3D space using:

- Real-time phase input  
- Curvature trajectory prediction  
- Output lens reconfiguration  
- Beam focus re-alignment

This is the harmonic **helm** of the IX-Godelian-Harmonic-Framework.

## 🧠 Inputs

- Phase vector maps from `/gyroscopic_feedback_t1.md`  
- Field anomalies from `/anomaly_logbook.md`  
- Reinforcement results from `/resonant_field_reinforcement.md`  
- Sensor feedback from `/telemetry_scope_array.md`

## 📐 Mapper Algorithm

### Primary Objective:
Ensure vector convergence of harmonic field aligns with intended curvature path **Φ_target(x, y, z)** at time **t**

```
Let Φ(t) be live phase vector array  
Let R(t) be current curvature matrix  
Let Φ_target(t) be desired convergence point  
Let ΔΦ(t) = Φ_target(t) – Φ(t)

Output correction vector:
R_corrected(t+1) = R(t) + K · ΔΦ(t)
```

- `K` is a curvature sensitivity constant  
- Corrections applied via projection lens morph logic

---

## 🌀 Real-Time Field Steering

- Adjusts **GVC curvature coils** to bend beam path dynamically  
- Biases **field projection lens** shape by +/–3% to redirect alignment  
- Can simulate "beam orbiting" behavior around unstable focal objects (e.g., rotating mass cores)

---

## 🧭 Phase Locking & Drift Correction

- Uses Kalman-like filter to reject noisy or unstable inputs  
- Applies forward projection window (t+1 → t+3) to anticipate convergence drift  
- Includes feedback damping to avoid runaway phase re-alignment loops

---

## 📊 Visualization Output

- Optional 3D projection to terminal showing:
  - Beam path  
  - ΔΦ vectors  
  - Real-time convergence error cones  
  - Residual drift map

---

## 🔐 Failover Mode

If Φ_target is unreachable within ΔΦ_max:

- DRM engages phase spiral contraction  
- Collapses output beam radius while increasing frequency modulation  
- Prevents field overextension or spatial echo collapse

---

## 🧬 Integration

- Steers all harmonic fields emitted by `/field_projection_lens.md`  
- Receives emergency shutdown triggers from `/signal_collapse_recovery.md`  
- Logs all correction vectors into `/anomaly_logbook.md`  
- Phase-path graphs sent to `/output_characteristics.md`
