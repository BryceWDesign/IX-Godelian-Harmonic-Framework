# Gankyil Vector Condenser – Tri-Axis Harmonic Convergence System

## 🌀 Overview

The **Gankyil Vector Condenser (GVC)** serves as the tri-loop unification hub where three independent field paths (G1, G2, G3) converge into a singular, phase-locked harmonic emission.

This module mirrors the Tibetan "Gankyil" symbol — representing the rotational unity of three forces — but in this case as:

- **Three orthogonal field loops**  
- **Harmonically entangled**  
- **Phase-stabilized**  
- **Energy-synchronized**

---

## 🧮 Mathematical Basis

Each loop contributes a vector field:

```math
F₁(t), F₂(t), F₃(t) ∈ ℝ³
```

The unified GVC output vector:

```math
F_GVC(t) = Σ_i=1^3 [R_i · F_i(t)]
```

Where \( R_i \) is the rotational transformation matrix applied to each loop to achieve phase coherence.

## 📐 Geometry

- **G1:** Base harmonic loop (X-axis dominant)  
- **G2:** Secondary loop (Y-axis, 90° offset)  
- **G3:** Stabilizer loop (Z-axis, completes right-hand orthogonal triad)

Each loop is wound using bifilar Tesla-style patterning and phase-matched for harmonic superposition.

## 🔄 Convergence Logic

1. **Receive F₁, F₂, F₃ from each loop driver**  
2. **Apply real-time phase offset correction via T1**  
3. **Use rotational matrices R₁–R₃ to align each field**  
4. **Sum all three into a phase-stable composite field**

```pseudocode
for each F_i:
    F_i_rotated = R_i · F_i(t)

F_GVC = F₁_rotated + F₂_rotated + F₃_rotated
```

## 🧲 Anti-Node Suppression

To prevent destructive interference, the GVC includes:

- **Phase anti-node detection**  
- **Node flattening logic via amplitude biasing**  
- **Dynamic harmonic cancellation (inversion mode)**

```pseudocode
if phase_overlap > threshold:
    reduce A_i on interfering loops
```

## ⚙️ Hardware Structure

- Tri-core toroidal coil block (3 nested concentric fields)  
- Central stabilizer cap with thermal bleed and resonance shunt  
- Real-time vector summing logic via FPGA or DSP layer

---

## 🧪 Test Profile

- Inject 3 orthogonal waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth)  
- Rotate harmonic phase for each  
- Log F_GVC vector and compare stability under stress

---

## 🔐 Failover Behavior

If any loop fails:
- Collapse to dual-loop Gankyil  
- Bias vector to favor remaining stable axis  
- Continue operation with reduced symmetry

---

## 🧬 Integration

- Receives field vectors from `/coil_formations_G1.md`, etc.  
- Accepts T1 correction from `/gyroscopic_feedback_t1.md`  
- Feeds into `/field_projection_lens.md` as unified emission core
