# Subsystem G1 – Gankyil Inertial Field Modulator

## 🧠 Purpose

The `G1` subsystem is the **dynamic curvature modulation engine** within the IX-Godelian-Harmonic-Framework. It governs real-time adjustments to the shape, direction, and stability of the rotating Gödelian field via **harmonic injection**, not mechanical force.

Built upon the **Gankyil triadic logic** (symbolizing movement, energy, and transformation in perfect balance), G1 is a **Tesla-inspired harmonic gyroscope** with zero moving parts, full waveform steering, and millisecond-scale response time.

## 🛠️ Operating Process

1. T1 detects a deviation in field curvature or phase symmetry
2. S1 confirms the harmonic vector divergence via reflected wave analysis
3. G1 receives this signal and selects the appropriate waveform injection profile
4. The triadic harmonic arms broadcast synchronized 3-6-9 phased pulses
5. These pulses reshape the curvature via resonance reinforcement or cancellation

## 🧮 Core Math Model

### Curve Steering Function

```math
\kappa_{\text{steer}}(t) = \gamma \cdot \sum_{n=1}^{3} \left( \frac{d^2\Phi_n}{dt^2} \cdot \cos(n \omega t) \right)
```

Where:
- \( \kappa(t) \) is the instantaneous curvature magnitude
- \( \Phi_n \) is the phase contribution from each Gankyil harmonic arm
- \( \omega \) is the injected waveform frequency
- \( \gamma \) is the gain coefficient (field sensitivity scaling)

### Output Target:
Field convergence aligned to pre-calculated triangulated spacetime attractor.

## 📐 Physical Design

```text
Top-Down Cross Section (Simplified)

        [Pulse Arm 1]
              |
              |
[MAG-LEV RING]---[Central Control Node]
              |
        [Pulse Arm 2]-----[Pulse Arm 3]

(Each arm: Tesla coil + waveform injector + directional deflection node)
```

All pulse arms are synchronized via centralized G1 controller and respond within ~0.3 ms of curvature anomaly detection.

## 🔋 Power Input Strategy

- G1 uses feedback-controlled energy from Z1 (ZeroCell driver)
- Active only when curvature deviation exceeds threshold
- G1 remains in harmonic standby until loop phase deviation occurs

## ⚙️ Stabilization Modes

| Mode Name       | Function                                            |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Resonant Lock    | Maintains existing curve geometry via 3-phase feed  |
| Phase Expand     | Gradually increases curvature to widen loop        |
| Harmonic Collapse| Actively cancels recursive overdrive harmonics      |
| Pulse Realign    | Resets rotational spin phase to prevent divergence |
