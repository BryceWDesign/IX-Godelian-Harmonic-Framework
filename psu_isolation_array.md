# PSU Isolation Array â€“ Galvanic Power Separation Grid

## âš¡ Purpose

To prevent cross-talk, modulation interference, or feedback loops between sensitive harmonic subsystems, the **PSU Isolation Array** ensures that each core module (G1, Z1, T1, S1, R1) receives **independently regulated and galvanically isolated power**.

This eliminates inductive and capacitive bleed-through that could corrupt waveform injection or telemetry sampling.

## ðŸ”Œ Subsystem Isolation Requirements

| Subsystem | PSU Requirement               | Isolation Method         | Max Current |
|-----------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| G1        | Clean 5V DC, ultra-low ripple | Transformer + opto-fused  | 1.2 A       |
| Z1        | High pulse capacity 12â€“24V    | Flyback + current fuse    | 2.5 A       |
| T1        | Stable 3.3V logic rail        | LDO + opto-isolation      | 0.5 A       |
| S1        | Variable Â±9V sensor bus       | Dual buck-boost + diode   | 0.8 A       |
| R1        | Configurable 5Vâ€“15V control   | Switched-mode isolation   | 1.0 A       |

## ðŸ”’ Ground Plane Strategy

Each PSU module shall:

- Use independent floating ground reference (GND_subsystem)  
- Tie all grounds to chassis *only through 1MÎ© resistor + 1nF cap* to suppress loop currents  
- Ensure **Z1** and **G1** *never share ground return path*

Use a star-ground architecture with one-way diodes to prevent reverse fault propagation.

## ðŸ§® Fault Isolation Design

- Fuse every PSU output with 1.25Ã— rated load fuse  
- Include crowbar diode on Z1 rail to shunt pulse spikes  
- Use soft-start regulators for G1 to prevent injection surge

---

## ðŸ§ª Test Procedures

1. Measure ripple on each PSU line under simulated injection load  
2. Confirm galvanic isolation using AC hipot test across each PSU-pair  
3. Trigger controlled short on one rail â€” ensure no crosstalk or module reset occurs

## ðŸ§¬ Power Management Philosophy

"Power is the hidden waveform."  
This array enforces **field purity through electrical hygiene**, ensuring that each subsystem acts like an island with surgical precision.

Even if Z1 shorts or G1 dumps high energy, no contamination reaches the sensing or timing rails.
