# SCRAM Protocol – Harmonic Shutdown and Inertial Grounding

## 🛑 Emergency Termination Logic

Invoked when:
- Compensation matrix fails to recover field coherence  
- Harmonic oversaturation exceeds damping thresholds  
- Manual SCRAM trigger issued (physical button or software override)

## 🔐 Multi-Layer Shutdown Cascade

```text
Phase 1: Terminate pulse generator at waveform origin  
Phase 2: Shunt remaining beam energy into absorber shell  
Phase 3: Nullify residual field via anti-harmonic dampers  
Phase 4: Ground inertial energy into tri-helical anchor ring  
Phase 5: System enter “resonant hibernation” (inert mode)
```

## ⚙️ Hardware Sequence

1. **HV Line Cutoff** – Breaks connection between capacitive reservoir and modulator driver  
2. **Fast Dump Relay** – Discharges inductive storage into carbon-layered braking mesh  
3. **Helical Inertia Grounding** – Tri-loop coils redirect inertia back into mechanical frame via vibration dump  
4. **Shell Phase Wash** – Ferrite shell pulse-cleaned with 180° destructive interference wave

## 📊 Logging and Verification

- TSA logs pre/post field collapse vector  
- DLV confirms successful null-point grounding  
- System verifies thermal safe-zone (ΔT < 12°C rise post event)

## 🔧 Reset and Recovery

- Once stable, system can be rearmed via `/core_stabilization_logic.md`  
- Beam will NOT restart until all feedback and damping systems pass integrity check

## ⚠️ Failure to Shutdown?

If SCRAM fails:
- Full system power cut  
- Backup FPGA runs inertial override dump (blackbox isolation mode)  
- Internal GPS lockout triggers encrypted incident marker  
- Incident flagged for full forensic diagnostic cycle
