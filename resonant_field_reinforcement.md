# Resonant Field Reinforcement – Phase Stabilization & Curvature Control

## 🧲 Function

The **Resonant Field Reinforcement (RFR)** module is a preemptive stabilizer that detects **edge-case field degradation** and actively corrects:

- Harmonic amplitude decay  
- Phase angle irregularity  
- Curvature vector misalignment

Rather than waiting for collapse, RFR **intervenes mid-decay** to maintain beam integrity.

## 🧮 Core Strategies

### 1. **Phase Pre-Bias Injection**

- Applies a low-energy pre-phase pattern ahead of the main harmonic waveform  
- Counteracts anticipated drift using historical delta vectors  
- Informed by TSA and Anomaly Logbook projections

### 2. **Curvature Dispersion Envelope (CDE)**

- Temporarily widens beam curvature envelope  
- Distributes energy over slightly larger field vector to reduce instability density  
- Realigns using post-pulse compression 20–40ms later

## ⚖️ Stability Algorithm

```
Let φ(t) be the beam phase vector
Let Δφ_max be maximum allowable drift

If dφ/dt > (0.85 × Δφ_max):
   - Inject φ_pre_bias(t) = –Kₚ · Δφ(t–1)
   - Engage CDE: widen beam envelope by 3–7%
   - Schedule realignment pulse at t+30ms
```

Where:
- `Kₚ` is a proportional gain constant derived from the harmonic profile
- Realignment pulse is guided by active GVC feedback

## 🛡️ Activation Thresholds

| Condition                               | Triggered Action         |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| dφ/dt > 0.85×Δφ_max                    | Phase pre-bias engaged   |
| Beam coherence drops below 92%         | CDE envelope deployed    |
| Curvature arc radius variance > 4.2%   | Post-pulse compression   |

## 🔮 Bonus Mode: Harmonic Hysteresis Dampening

- Uses previous 3 field cycles to estimate momentum in phase drift  
- Applies inverse damped harmonic suppression in a π/2 offset
