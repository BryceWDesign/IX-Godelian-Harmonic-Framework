# Field Projection Lens – Harmonic Beam Vector Shaping & Emission Control

## 🔭 Purpose

The **Field Projection Lens** is the final shaping stage for the GVC output, responsible for:

- Vector alignment and beam shaping  
- Phase coherence across emission radius  
- Real-world curvature-point targeting  
- Anti-scatter harmonic filtering

Think of this as the lens on a laser — but designed to emit modulated spacetime curvature vectors.

## 🎯 Core Functions

1. **Receive F_GVC(t)** from Gankyil Vector Condenser  
2. **Apply beam shaping matrix \( M_s \)** based on desired focal outcome  
3. **Align output phase vectors with projection aperture grid**  
4. **Emit curvature-focused harmonic beam through resonance-stabilized port**

---

## 🧮 Mathematical Projection

```math
F_out(t) = M_s · F_GVC(t)
```

Where \( M_s \) is the shaping matrix:

```math
M_s = R_θ · S_r · A_w
```

- \( R_θ \): rotational alignment  
- \( S_r \): spatial focus scaling  
- \( A_w \): wavefront aperture phase correction

## 📐 Emission Control Parameters

| Parameter     | Description                                |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Aperture Size | Controls beam diameter                     |
| Phase Spread  | Controls divergence vs tight focusing      |
| Curvature Lock| Locks vector to real-world point in space  |
| Temporal Width| Defines duration of projection burst       |

## 🛡️ Anti-Scatter Lattice

To prevent field bleed or vector leakage, the lens contains:

- EM-transparent bismuth lattice overlay  
- Toroidal resonance ring to guide phase edges  
- Harmonic filter tuned to reject sideband leakage

---

## ⚙️ Lens Materials

- **Core:** Crystalline quartz with graphene lattice dopant  
- **Edges:** Toroid-shaped EM-resonant copper rings  
- **Optional:** Plasma window overlay (for open-vacuum applications)

## 🔁 Pulse Mode Options

| Mode        | Effect                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Continuous  | Full projection stream (max load)       |
| Pulsed      | Short harmonic burst (min decoherence)  |
| Sweep       | Angular scan through focal plane        |
| Multi-Point | Split vector toward triangulated points |

## 🧪 Testing Regimes

- Project into vapor chamber to visualize curvature arcs  
- Compare emission angle stability across temperature changes  
- Sweep vector through test grid and log deviation
