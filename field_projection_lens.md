# Field Projection Lens ‚Äì Dynamic Aperture Control & Harmonic Beam Shaping

## üß≤ Purpose

The **Field Projection Lens** governs the **spatial geometry** of the emitted harmonic field. It is a **programmable aperture array** that:

- Shapes output beam via dynamic curvature control  
- Projects encoded field harmonics  
- Reacts in real-time to phase drift and curvature commands

This is the system‚Äôs **mouthpiece** ‚Äî it determines how the field enters spacetime.

## üî© Construction

### 1. **Lens Array Type**

- Material: Hybrid **metamaterial-ferrite mesh**, copper-infused  
- Aperture: Concentric ring geometry with spiral biasing tracks  
- Programmable via low-voltage EM field modulation across micro-struts

### 2. **Shape Memory Elements**

- Uses **Nitinol tendon filaments** for shape morphing  
- Resets aperture shape within **~35 ms**  
- Controlled by GVC curvature loop for synchronized realignment

## üåÄ Emission Modes

| Mode             | Beam Pattern         | Description                           |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Linear Cone      | Gaussian taper       | Default long-range coherent mode       |
| Toroidal Vortex  | Donut-shaped         | Used for resonance tunneling effects   |
| Spiral Vector    | Logarithmic spiral   | Embeds field ID & directionality       |
| Triangular Array | Tri-beam lattice     | Triadic pulse chaining (Tesla 3-6-9)   |

## üßÆ Beam Shaping Logic

```
If ŒîŒ¶(t) > drift_threshold:
   Morph lens shape toward Spiral Vector
Else if CDE engaged:
   Switch to Toroidal Vortex for lateral dispersion
Else if DRM requests Triadic Burst:
   Shift to Triangular Array mode

Lens shape transitions over 20‚Äì35 ms using dual-actuation model
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Integration Pathways

- Accepts real-time shape commands from `/dynamic_resonance_mapper.md`  
- Responds to pulse triggers from `/signal_collapse_recovery.md`  
- Modifies energy profile logged in `/output_characteristics.md`  
- Reports aperture status to `/telemetry_scope_array.md`

## üß¨ Notes on Physical Realization

- Lens structure buildable using hybrid MEMS/Nitinol array (real-world manufacturable)  
- Entire lens module consumes < 12W during shape transition  
- No moving parts in traditional mechanical sense ‚Äî relies on **field-responsive geometry**
