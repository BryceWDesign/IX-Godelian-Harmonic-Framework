# Lens Alignment Protocol â€“ Harmonic Beam Targeting & Drift Minimization

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This protocol governs **precise alignment of the harmonic projection lens**, ensuring:

- Origin-to-target beam consistency  
- Reduced angular drift  
- Stabilized waveform focus  
- Elimination of beam vector skew under high load

Without this: the system **wobbles** and coherence suffers.

## ðŸ§­ Pre-Alignment Conditions

- TSA reports curvature Î” < 1.2Â°  
- DRM in low-variance state  
- No active RFR injection during alignment  
- External vibrational noise < 0.4 mm/s

---

## ðŸ§° Tools Required

- Interferometric calibration grid (optional)  
- Internal laser test pulse at 637 nm  
- Micro-servo lens actuators (sub-micron precision)  
- Phase matching circuit monitor

---

## ðŸ§ª Calibration Steps

1. **Engage TSA in static scan mode**  
2. **Emit alignment test pulse (non-harmonic, linear beam)**  
3. **Scan lens response pattern** and adjust to eliminate:
   - Asymmetry
   - Off-axis energy dispersion
   - Ringing patterns in temporal curve

4. **Compare beam origin vs output centroid**
   - Required offset tolerance: â‰¤ 12.5 Î¼rad

5. **Lock servo state**
   - DRM sets phase anchor points

6. **Store alignment matrix**
   - Available for emergency realignment calls

## ðŸ§¼ Notes

- Alignment matrix is stored in `/core_stabilization_logic.md`  
- All lens settings can be overridden by SCR module if collapse is imminent  
- Ideal alignment reduces curvature drift by up to 73% under full load  
- Protocol takes ~1.2 sec total with calibrated hardware
