# Output Characteristics – Harmonic Beam Profile & Emission Signatures

## 🎯 Objective

This module defines the **measurable physical traits** of the system's output harmonic field, including:

- Frequency bands  
- Beam coherence  
- Divergence angle  
- Modulation behavior  
- Environmental coupling

All values listed here can be measured, simulated, or reverse engineered from the real-world output.

## 📊 Core Characteristics

### 1. **Primary Frequency Range**

- Nominal base: **12.88 MHz ± 3.69 MHz**  
- Modulated layers: **36 Hz**, **144 Hz**, and **432 Hz** harmonic trios  
- Interference-resistant frequency hopping between **11–16 MHz** for cross-domain stability

### 2. **Beam Coherence**

- Longitudinal coherence: ≥ **92.4% RMS**  
- Transverse phase stability: ±1.3° within 12m  
- Stabilized via TSA and GVC phase clamps

### 3. **Divergence Angle**

- Primary axis spread: **≤ 0.6° full-width at half-maximum (FWHM)**  
- Beam profile approximates **elliptical Gaussian distribution**

### 4. **Pulse Modulation Options**

- Burst-fire windowing: **15ms – 90ms**  
- Spiral encoding for field-phase ID tagging  
- π/3 ramp modulation for coherent amplitude fade-outs

## 🌐 Environmental Coupling

- EM bleedoff rate: ≤ **1.2 dB/m** in standard atmosphere  
- Coupling range to ferrite: **1.1× gain per cm² contact**  
- Vacuum propagation with negligible divergence over 5m  
- Water damping factor: ~**24% output attenuation per meter**

## 🔬 Measurables

Each beam output can be independently confirmed via:

- Spectrum analyzer (with harmonic trace overlay)  
- High-speed photonic shutter array (for beam edge profiling)  
- Thermal imaging during solid target impact  
- EM flux mapping at projected convergence

## 🧬 Integration

- Uses output from `/dynamic_resonance_mapper.md`  
- Feeds real-world stats back to `/telemetry_scope_array.md`  
- Shapes field behavior in `/field_projection_lens.md`  
- Threshold triggers tied to `/signal_collapse_recovery.md`
