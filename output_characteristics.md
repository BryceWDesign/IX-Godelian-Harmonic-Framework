# Output Characteristics – Harmonic Field Emission Signatures

## 📡 Purpose

This defines the **beam output waveform** for:
- External diagnostics  
- Field signature recognition  
- Harmonic validation  
- Phase resonance tuning

---

## 🔊 Waveform Profile

### Primary Output Type: Phase-modulated harmonic burst  
- Base carrier: 3.33 MHz  
- Harmonics: 9.99 MHz, 19.98 MHz  
- Modulation: Tesla 3-6-9 sequence encoding

Pulse Profile:
[3-3-6-6-9-9] — [phase sweep] — [resonant burst] — [recovery null] — repeat
```

---

## 🧬 Phase Behavior

- Field is NOT constant — it "pulses" in timed harmonic intervals  
- Null states allow resonance decay sampling by TSA  
- Allows for mid-cycle interference rejection and feedback re-shaping

---

## 🧲 Emission Shell Shape

- Toroidal axial burst + outward helical fringe  
- Central beam: coherent, focused  
- Fringe zone: dissipative, damped via paramagnetic shell (see: `/harmonic_field_geometry.md`)

---

## 🔁 Runtime Variability

- If beam is rejected or distorted, SCR triggers waveform override  
- Output can shift to **chirped sweep pulse** if harmonic coherence drops below 85%

---

## 🔒 Security Features

- Encoded waveform sequence is non-repeating and non-reversible externally  
- Phase offset keys embedded in 6th cycle only (locked loop protection)

---

## ✅ Verification Paths

- Output signature can be logged by `/drift_log_visualizer.md`  
- Field strength, harmonic alignment, and offset are fully reconstructable from 3D TSA logs  
- Matches resonance tunnel specs used in IX-ThermaForge and IX-Spin-and-Burst
