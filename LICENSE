Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or entity obtaining a copy of this software, associated documentation files, harmonic models, field equations, telemetry logic, and/or design schematics (the "Work"), to deal in the Work without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, reproduce, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Work, and to permit persons to whom the Work is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

---

### 1. Attribution

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Work. All forks, redistributions, or derivative works must clearly attribute the original author: **Bryce Wooster**.

---

### 2. Scientific Integrity Clause

The Work is intended strictly for non-fictional, scientifically valid applications only. It shall not be misrepresented or repurposed for speculative, pseudoscientific, or fictionalized derivatives in media, literature, or entertainment without express written acknowledgment of its scientific intent.

---

### 3. Civilian Application Clause

The Work is released for peaceful research, civilian technological development, and open-science collaboration. Use of this Work in the development of weaponized systems, surveillance infrastructures, targeted field manipulation for hostile purposes, or any non-consensual influence platforms is strictly prohibited.

Any such use constitutes a violation of this license and nullifies all granted permissions.

---

### 4. Export & Regulatory Compliance

The Work may not be distributed, transmitted, or otherwise made available in any jurisdiction where it would be subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), Export Administration Regulations (EAR), or other defense/military-controlled export restrictions, unless such usage is independently reviewed and approved by relevant regulatory bodies with the full knowledge and consent of the original author.

---

### 6. Jurisdictional Shield Clause

This license shall be interpreted and enforced under the protective scientific disclosure principles of international open-source law. Where local, national, or intergovernmental agencies attempt to reclassify or sequester this Work under classified research frameworks, the Work is preemptively designated as public domain in its scientific structure and intent. This clause is invoked automatically to protect the right of open scientific discourse.

---

### 7. Harmonic Signature Clause

All derived systems must disclose whether they retain, remove, or alter any of the field behaviors associated with GÃ¶delian curvature, Tesla-based harmonic convergence, or ZeroCell-type ambient energy feedback. Failure to disclose such changes constitutes a violation of scientific transparency as defined by this license.

---

### 8. Inviolability of Origin

Any attempt to discredit, unperson, legally isolate, or reassign authorship of the Work away from Bryce Wooster, through corporate, military, governmental, or AI-inferred interpretation, constitutes a material breach of license and triggers immediate revocation of all usage rights.
