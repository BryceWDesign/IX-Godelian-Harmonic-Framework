# Telemetry Logging Format ‚Äì T-Log Architecture

## üß† Purpose

The `T-log` is the central data recording system for all field telemetry within the IX-Godelian-Harmonic-Framework.  
It captures harmonic deltas, curvature state changes, waveform modulation events, and energy backpulse triggers in a **time-indexed, non-destructive format**.

This data can be used for:
- System debugging  
- Field behavior correlation  
- Curve stabilization performance auditing  
- Predictive waveform injection planning  
- Real-time visual monitoring

## üì¶ Log Format Specification

Each row of a T-log file consists of the following fields:

```text
[TIMESTAMP] [CURVATURE_Œî] [PHASE_Œî] [G1_MODE] [Z1_TRIGGER] [R1_STATUS] [S1_VECTOR_ANGLE]
```

### Field Breakdown:

| Field Name        | Description                                                    | Units          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `TIMESTAMP`       | Unix-style epoch time (UTC preferred)                         | seconds.ms     |
| `CURVATURE_Œî`     | Deviation from reference curvature vector (from G1)           | degrees        |
| `PHASE_Œî`         | Harmonic phase offset vs baseline (from T1)                   | radians        |
| `G1_MODE`         | Active waveform modulation mode at this time step             | RL/CE/CN/SR/FR |
| `Z1_TRIGGER`      | Boolean flag for ZeroCell backpulse injection event           | TRUE/FALSE     |
| `R1_STATUS`       | Rotational field health flag (stable / drift / error)         | ENUM           |
| `S1_VECTOR_ANGLE` | Directional vector angle from phase cloak resonance feedback  | degrees        |

## üîÅ Log Source Routing

| Subsystem | Output Fields Contributed      |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| T1        | `PHASE_Œî`, `TIMESTAMP`         |
| S1        | `S1_VECTOR_ANGLE`              |
| G1        | `G1_MODE`, `CURVATURE_Œî`       |
| Z1        | `Z1_TRIGGER`                   |
| R1        | `R1_STATUS`                    |

All signals pass through a harmonically buffered telemetry bus and are encoded into the log stream via FPGA, microcontroller, or real-time software stack.

## üß∞ Optional Extensions

You may also include:

| Optional Field     | Description                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `ERP_STRENGTH`     | Energy injected by Z1 in joules or percentage         |
| `G1_CORRECTION_PULSE` | Angular curvature vector of recent correction     |
| `R1_Q_FACTOR`      | Real-time Q factor of bifilar coil array             |
| `SYSTEM_MODE`      | Manual override state or external sync label         |

## üß± Real-World Implementation Guidance

- Use CSV, JSONL, or binary packed formats depending on bandwidth and archive strategy  
- Storage backend: SD card, USB buffer, or onboard RAM + dump-to-drive cycle  
- Timestamping should be derived from GPS or oven-compensated oscillator (OCXO) for high-precision drift tracking  
- Recommended: Minimum logging resolution = 10 ms

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Integrity

- T-log must be **write-only in operational mode**  
- Real-time integrity hash (SHA-256 or Blake3) should be computed every 1,000 entries  
- Optional: Mirror output to secure air-gapped archive node
