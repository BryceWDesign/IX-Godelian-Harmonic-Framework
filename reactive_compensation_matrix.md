# Reactive Compensation Matrix – Emergency Field Recovery

## 🚨 Objective

This module is invoked **when phase collapse or harmonic inversion** is detected and immediate field stabilization is required.

Function: 
- Inject inverse-phase harmonics  
- Rebalance energy loops  
- Prevent full collapse or hardware feedback failure

---

## 🧮 Matrix Model

```text
If ΔΦ > 12° and coherence < 88%:
    Inject [Inverse-3, Inverse-6, Inverse-9]
    Re-lock phase to last known stable set
    Route to emergency loop (#4) for passive damping
```

All logic resolved in <2μs via dedicated response microcontroller (or FPGA).

## 🔁 Loop Injection Mapping

| Harmonic | Inverse Injection | Delay (μs) | Damping Curve |
|----------|-------------------|------------|----------------|
| 3        | –3                | 0.75       | Exponential    |
| 6        | –6                | 1.10       | Linear decay   |
| 9        | –9                | 1.50       | Logarithmic    |

## 🧪 Hardware Behavior

- Inductive relay dump into auxiliary damping coils  
- Paramagnetic shell absorbs reflected energy  
- Zero energy re-loop into main beam path during event

---

## 🧠 Smart Control Logic

- Stores 3 recent collapse vectors  
- Learns collapse behavior over time (entropy patterning)  
- Dynamically pre-triggers stabilization if trends detected

---

## 💡 Diagnostic Outputs

- Logs all events with timestamp, ΔΦ, coherence %, damping result  
- Accessible via DLV and TSA APIs  
- Printable vector logs auto-saved to `/output_characteristics.md` for post-run analysis

---

## ⚠️ Safety Thresholds

If collapse vector exceeds safe limits:
- System routes to `/scram_protocol.md`  
- Beam terminated, field grounded, harmonic systems inertialized
