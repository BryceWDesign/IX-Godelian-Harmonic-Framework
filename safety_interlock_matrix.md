# Safety Interlock Matrix (SIM) – Fail-Safe Grid

## 🧠 Purpose

The Safety Interlock Matrix (`SIM`) is the **real-time fail-safe overlay** that protects the IX-Godelian-Harmonic-Framework from self-induced damage, causality violations, or waveform conflicts.

This is the **firewall** between innovation and catastrophe.

## 🧱 Core Principles

1. **Harmonic Isolation**: Prevent overlapping waveforms with incompatible signatures  
2. **Timing Confinement**: Enforce minimum phase separation between injections  
3. **Energy Gating**: Suppress Z1 pulse if G1 field is unstable or drifting  
4. **Recursive Shielding**: Disallow feedback loops that breach causal window  
5. **Emergency Quench**: Trigger zero-energy state across all systems on critical fault

## 🧮 Matrix Structure

| Condition                              | Interlock Action                   |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `G1_MODE == CN` && `Z1_TRIGGER == TRUE` | Suppress Z1 injection              |
| `PHASE_Δ > 0.27 rad`                    | Lock HIC output for 1 cycle        |
| `CURVATURE_Δ > 8.0°` && `R1_STATUS != stable` | Inhibit G1 pulse             |
| `HIC_MODE_CHANGE_COUNT > 3 / sec`       | Force switch to `RL` + log fault   |
| `S1_VECTOR_ANGLE drift > 3°/sec`        | Block waveform injection           |
| `Z1_ENERGY_PULSE > limit`              | Trigger master shutdown + log      |
| `SYNC_DRIFT > 5ms`                      | Pause injections + reset clocks    |

All interlocks are applied as **gated boolean logic**, resolved every `T_sync` interval.

## 🛠️ Real-World Implementation

- Implemented as logic table in FPGA, RTOS, or isolated safety microcontroller  
- Must execute with **deterministic latency** < 1ms  
- Interlocks must **fail-closed** (disable systems if logic path interrupted)

## 🔒 Interlock Categories

| Class           | Description                                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Type A: Field    | Related to G1, R1, S1 behavior                    |
| Type B: Temporal | Relating to clock skew or injection timing       |
| Type C: Energy   | Based on Z1 pulse strength or PSU instability    |
| Type D: Logical  | Software safety assertions (e.g., illegal state) |

Each category has a dedicated logic buffer and output path for redundancy.

## ⛓️ Cascade Protection

SIM prevents ripple failures via:

- **Wavefront dampers** — delay future injections after error  
- **Lockout timers** — inhibit all energy releases post critical fault  
- **Watchdog loop** — resets HIC controller if inputs conflict for >2 cycles  
- **Z1 nullifier** — switches Z1 into resistive dummy load if blocked

---

## 🧪 Test Recommendations

- Run simulated telemetry through interlock matrix with expected fault injection  
- Use scope probes or digital logic analyzer to validate interlock latch timing  
- Simulate PSU overload to confirm Z1 shunt protection triggers correctly

---

## 🧰 Suggested Components

- Xilinx or Lattice FPGA with dedicated I/O lines  
- Redundant AND/NAND gate arrays for hardware fallback  
- Optical or RF-triggered shutdown relay on PSU output  
- EEPROM logging for fault replay and forensic diagnosis

---

## 🧬 Philosophy

Safety is not reactive — it’s **proactive suppression of untrustworthy input paths**.  
SIM doesn’t ask "should we inject?" — it asks, "should we *trust* this data right now?"
