# IX-Godelian-Harmonic-Framework – Hardware System Schematic

## 🧩 Purpose

This file defines the **real-world buildable hardware architecture** for the IX-Godelian-Harmonic-Framework. Every subsystem is grounded in known physics and constructed using accessible, non-fictional materials and methods.

This document outlines the **physical stack**, **energy flow**, **telemetry routing**, and **resonant field stabilization logic** required to actualize Gödel-style field behavior without exotic matter or unprovable physics.

## 🔧 Component Breakdown

### `R1 – Rotational Core Array`

- **Core Material**: Ferrite-core toroidal coils  
- **Winding Configuration**: Bifilar + tri-coil hybrid Tesla design  
- **Driver**: Programmable harmonic generator (3/6/9 Hz base frequencies; phase-controlled)  
- **Rotation Type**: Electromagnetic pseudo-rotation (no mechanical spin)  
- **Stability Assist**: Cryo-cooled coil jacket (optional)

---

### `S1 – Phase Cloak Sensor Ring`

- **Components**:
  - 12 passive Tesla coils, 3-6-9 phasing
  - EM-resonant foil reflectors behind sensor plane
  - No direct field voltage sampling — only harmonic reflection analysis

- **Output**:
  - Curvature vector differentials via phase delay  
  - Processed through analog-to-harmonic interpreters  
  - No data collapse — only resonance matching

---

### `G1 – Gankyil Inertial Field Modulator`

- **Physical Format**: Suspended 3-arm mag-lev ring with harmonic injectors  
- **Control**: Real-time waveform correction via tri-harmonic signal pump  
- **Effect**: Dynamically reshapes the rotating field geometry to match desired spacetime curvature path  
- **Response Time**: Sub-millisecond feedback loop with waveform sync-lock

---

### `Z1 – ZeroCell Ambient Backpulse Driver`

- **Purpose**: Stabilizes field decay caused by internal energy drain  
- **Method**:
  - Harvest ambient EM noise  
  - Pulse inject back into decaying harmonics (via phase-matched reentry)  
- **Control Signal**: Curvature deviation triggers based on `T1` data

---

### `T1 – Telemetry Tap and Delay Circuit`

- **Function**: Measures differential harmonic signature without collapsing state  
- **Design**:
  - Analog waveform comparator  
  - Micro-delay loop to capture phase without direct observation  
  - Converts differential into usable curve data

## 🧪 Assembly Notes

- **Do not** use mechanical rotation — entire system is field-based rotation only  
- **Avoid** direct EM probes — use phase harmonic reflectors for observation  
- All timing must be harmonically divisible by 3 for phase lock to sustain  
- Recommended: Integrate cryogenic field jacket to reduce signal scattering in R1 during high-spin phase
