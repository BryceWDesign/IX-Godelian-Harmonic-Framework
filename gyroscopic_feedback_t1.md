# T1 Gyroscopic Feedback Loop – Inertial Correction & Vector Sync

## 🎯 Purpose

This module feeds **real-time inertial sensor data** into the T1 timing controller to:

- Detect drift in rotational reference  
- Apply harmonic phase correction to align with physical gyroscopic behavior  
- Ensure curvature pulses (Z1) remain directionally true over time

---

## 🧭 Sensors

- **MEMS Gyroscopes** (3-axis)  
- **Fiber-Optic Gyroscopes** (FOG) optional for high-res mode  
- **Sampling Rate:** 10 kHz minimum  
- **Precision:** ±0.01°/s (typical)

Sensor data is processed as quaternion delta changes:

```math
Δq = q_t – q_{t–1}
```

Converted into Euler vector Δθ for pulse vector realignment.

## ⚙️ Signal Pipeline

1. **Sample Δθ from Gyro**  
2. **Low-pass filter** to remove high-frequency noise  
3. **Integrate Δθ over rolling 50ms window**  
4. **Compare with φ_T1 (desired phase vector)**  
5. **Apply corrective offset if drift > 0.15 rad**

```pseudocode
if |Δθ – φ_T1| > 0.15 rad:
    φ_T1 += Δθ_correction
```

## 🔄 Phase Auto-Correction

Applies a rolling bias into the T1 phase signal:

```math
φ_T1_corrected(t) = φ_T1(t) + ∫₀^t Δθ(τ) dτ
```

Ensures long-term phase lock even in unstable environments.

## 🧪 Real-World Use Cases

| Scenario                          | Correction Applied       |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Platform drift due to field load  | Gyro-based φ offset       |
| Beam loop instability             | Phase bias added to T1    |
| Harmonic jitter in G1 injections  | Synchronized vector rebias|

---

## 📊 Diagnostic Output

- Instantaneous Δθ vector (3-axis)  
- φ_T1 vs corrected φ_T1 trace  
- Vector jitter histogram  
- Phase lock success rate (rolling average)

---

## 🔐 Fault Response

If Δθ exceeds 5°/s for >250ms:
- Enter inertial stabilization mode  
- Suspend waveform injection  
- Realign reference orientation  
- Resume once stable (<1°/s for 500ms)
