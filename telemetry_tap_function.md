# Subsystem T1 – Telemetry Tap and Delay Circuit

## 🧠 Purpose

The `T1` subsystem allows for **non-invasive observation** of the harmonic field generated within the rotating Gödelian containment structure.  
Traditional sensor arrays collapse the recursive field behavior due to direct voltage sampling, quantum observation interference, or probe-induced decoherence.

The T1 system **avoids collapse entirely** by operating as a **harmonic phase differential extractor**, not a classical measurement device.

## 🔬 Engineering Principle

### Problem:
Any conventional probe or sensor introduces:
- Field distortion
- Waveform collapse
- Causality interference via active EM interaction

### Solution:
Use **harmonic comparison**, not detection.

T1 is built to:
- **Mirror** the ambient field without direct interaction  
- **Delay** and **phase-shift** the mirrored waveform  
- **Compare** the delayed reflection to a known reference harmonic  
- **Derive** curvature, rotation rate, and stability via waveform *delta*, not absolute field strength

## 🧪 Calibration Process

1. **Initialize R1 rotation field**  
2. **Let T1 receive passive ambient waveforms**  
3. **Activate Microdelay at calibrated `τ` = 11.1 ns** (harmonically tuned to 3.0e8 m/s carrier path division)  
4. **Phase Splitter isolates base 3, 6, and 9 harmonics**  
5. **Comparator identifies drift from baseline harmonic structure**  
6. **Output is fed to G1 and optionally stored via T-log**

## 🛡️ Anti-Decoherence Strategy

T1 never collapses the field state because:
- No voltage or charge flows into the field  
- All components are **passive**, tuned to absorb **only** harmonic reflections  
- Phase delay + resonance filtering ensures **pure waveform comparison**, not extraction

## 🧮 Core Math Model

```math
\Delta \Psi(x, t) = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \left[ \Psi_{\text{ref}}(x, t) - \Psi_{\text{env}}(x + \delta x, t + \delta t) \right] d\phi
```

Where:
- \( \Psi_{\text{ref}} \) is the harmonic control signal
- \( \Psi_{\text{env}} \) is the field mirror input
- \( \delta x, \delta t \) are spatial and temporal delays applied by the microdelay loop

This equation captures curvature and rotational deviation **without causing phase collapse**.
