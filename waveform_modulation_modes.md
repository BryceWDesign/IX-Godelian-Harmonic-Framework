# Waveform Modulation Modes ‚Äì G1/R1 Harmonic Control Matrix

## üéØ Purpose

This file defines the **programmable waveform profiles** used by the G1 subsystem (Gankyil Field Modulator) to steer and correct curvature geometry inside the R1 rotational field engine.

Each waveform mode uses Tesla 3-6-9 harmonic logic and can be deployed independently or layered for hybrid field behaviors.

All waveforms are **real**, programmable, and can be generated using standard signal synthesis hardware or FPGA controllers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Modulation Mode Overview

| Mode Name         | Code | Function                                                   |
|-------------------|------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Resonant Lock     | `RL` | Maintains existing curvature using phase-matched injection |
| Curve Expansion   | `CE` | Gradually increases radius of curvature loop               |
| Collapse Neutral  | `CN` | Reduces recursive loop strength to prevent overdrive       |
| Spin Realignment  | `SR` | Adjusts phase origin to stabilize drifting rotational axis |
| Field Recoil Damp | `FR` | Cancels residual harmonics from overcorrection events      |

## üßÆ Mathematical Profiles

### 1. Resonant Lock (`RL`)

```math
W_{RL}(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{3} \cos(n \omega t)
```

- Keeps the field in its current curvature shape  
- Used for phase maintenance during steady-state operations  
- No expansion or compression induced

---

### 2. Curve Expansion (`CE`)

```math
W_{CE}(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{3} \cos(n \omega t + \Delta \phi_n(t))
```

Where:
- \( \Delta \phi_n(t) = \beta \cdot t \)

- Gradually shifts each harmonic phase to enlarge curvature radius  
- Injects phase acceleration ‚Üí wider spacetime arc

---

### 3. Collapse Neutral (`CN`)

```math
W_{CN}(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{3} \cos(n \omega t - \gamma \cdot \log(t + 1))
```

- Reduces loop tension slowly without phase shock  
- Used to shut down unstable recursive loops safely  
- Smooth exit vector with minimal backreflection

---

### 4. Spin Realignment (`SR`)

```math
W_{SR}(t) = \cos(3\omega t + \theta_0) + \cos(6\omega t + \theta_0) + \cos(9\omega t + \theta_0)
```

Where:
- \( \theta_0 \) is the new target phase origin

- Re-centers the field‚Äôs internal rotation to match control vector  
- Used when drift exceeds 11.1¬∞ or triangulated attractor desynchronizes

---

### 5. Field Recoil Damp (`FR`)

```math
W_{FR}(t) = \epsilon \cdot \left[ \cos(3\omega t + \pi) + \cos(6\omega t + \pi) + \cos(9\omega t + \pi) \right]
```

Where:
- \( \epsilon < 0.2 \) to prevent field flattening

- Counter-phase pulse mode  
- Cancels latent overcorrection energy before recursive resonance amplifies it

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Architecture

Each mode is delivered through:
- G1 harmonic injectors (3-arm Tesla coil drivers)
- Phase-locked delay circuits for multi-mode layering
- Output pulse is **injected into the R1 bifilar winding** in 1‚Äì3 ms bursts

### Timing Constraints:
- Never mix `CE` and `CN` simultaneously  
- `SR` must follow at least 1 full cycle after any `FR` event  
- All waveform generators must be clock-synced to G1‚Äôs internal telemetry gate

---

## üì¶ Hardware Requirements

- Multi-channel waveform synthesizer (‚â•3 channels, nanosecond sync tolerance)  
- Phase-adjustable delay line per harmonic channel  
- Optional: Analog phase multipliers for passive feedback echo buffering

## üìò Usage Scenarios

| Scenario                                | Recommended Mode(s) |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Maintaining stable field curvature      | RL                   |
| Preparing to widen loop for observation | CE                   |
| Preventing runaway recursion            | CN ‚Üí FR              |
| Correcting slow curve drift             | SR                   |
| Re-initializing spin after instability  | SR ‚Üí RL              |
