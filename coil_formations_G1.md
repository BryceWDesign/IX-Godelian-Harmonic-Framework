# G1 Coil Formations ‚Äì Tesla 3-6-9 Harmonic Winding Guide

## üåÄ Purpose

The G1 unit's core function is harmonic waveform **generation and emission**.  
Coil geometry, winding pattern, and layering **directly influence**:

- Field curvature shape  
- Phase lock timing  
- Interference suppression  
- Harmonic amplitude scaling

This guide documents the **optimal coil topologies** to produce stable G√∂delian harmonic fields.

## üßÆ Harmonic Geometry Alignment (Tesla 3-6-9)

All coils adhere to the following spatial logic:

- Bifilar coils ‚Üí inject **6-phase** pulses across 3 planes  
- Toroidal trifoil ‚Üí rotate field around 9-node centroid  
- Spiral base ‚Üí ground return uses **Fibonacci lattice offset**

The **overall formation** is a 3-coil triangulation:

```
      [ Bifilar Coil ]
           / \
          /   \
  [ Toroid ]   [ Spiral Base ]
```

This topology forms a **rotating harmonic torus**, anchored to the golden mean, ensuring **non-destructive field expansion**.

## üîç Notes on Field Behavior

- Field envelope breathes in 3-6-9 nested layers  
- Energy density peaks at vector convergence node  
- Induced phase-lock jitter should be <1.7ms max  
- Output amplitude is proportional to alignment accuracy across Fibonacci turns

## üß™ Calibration Method

1. Pulse G1 at 3Hz, 6Hz, 9Hz test frequencies  
2. Use a Gaussmeter and laser interferometer to track nodal wobble  
3. Tune coil spacing and alignment until vector convergence point is <0.3mm shift over 5s

## üß∞ Assembly Tools Suggested

- Non-magnetic jig fixtures  
- Turn-counting motorized winder  
- 3D-printed coil mandrels with slotting for layer guides  
- Optical comparator for angular precision check
