# Core Stabilization Logic – Beam Phase Regulation & Collapse Rejection

## 🎯 Objective

This module forms the **central regulation loop** that prevents collapse, phase tearing, or coherence loss under load. 

It functions as the **neural feedback core** for all other modules:
- TSA (telemetry)
- DRM (resonance shaping)
- SCR (signal collapse response)
- RFR (reinforcement)
- DLV (diagnostic logging)

---

## 🔁 Feedback Loop Design

```python
while True:
    C = TSA.coherence()
    Φ = TSA.phase()
    drift = DRM.get_drift()

    if C < 92%:
        RFR.inject(harmonic="3-6-9", amp=0.25)

    if drift > 1.5°:
        DRM.remap(phase_target=Φ)

    if SCR.triggered():
        SCR.route_emergency()
        break
```

All feedback is sub-μs loop latency (optimized via edge-pulse sampling hardware).

## 🧬 Integration Points

- Pulls calibration from `/lens_alignment_protocol.md`  
- Stores locked phase profiles to `/output_characteristics.md`  
- RFR, TSA, and SCR all communicate via shared memory channel

---

## 🧠 Smart Logic

- Adapts feedback thresholds dynamically based on ambient environment  
- If repeated anomalies occur in <10s, raises aggressiveness of response  
- Supports sleep mode for non-active transmission intervals

---

## 💾 Emergency Storage

- Stores last 6 phase configurations locally  
- Auto-uploads post-run to DLV  
- Can restore from these in cold-boot or mid-failure restart

---

## 🧪 Notes

- No exotic materials required — logic-only module  
- Firmware-safe; runs on low-RAM embedded systems  
- 3-6-9 reinforcement is the only harmonic injection method accepted at this layer
