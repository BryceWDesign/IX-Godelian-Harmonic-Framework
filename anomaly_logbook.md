# Anomaly Logbook ‚Äì Harmonic Event Journal & Fault Archive

## üìò Purpose

The **Anomaly Logbook** functions as a persistent, tamper-proof record of all system-level irregularities:

- Field collapses  
- Harmonic drift  
- Unmapped interference  
- Unexplained sensor deltas  
- Recovery timelines and system responses

This file is the **black box** of the IX-Godelian-Harmonic-Framework.

## üßæ Log Entry Format

Each event is logged as:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS]  
EVENT: <event_type>  
PHASE: <active_subsystem>  
VECTOR_DRIFT: <¬∞>  
AMPLITUDE_VARIANCE: <¬±%>  
DETECTED_BY: <TSA/SCOPE/T1>  
RESPONSE: <action_taken>  
REBOOT_TIME: <ms>  
NOTES: <optional freeform notes>
```

## üîê Storage Rules

- Write-once log system (append only)  
- Stored on redundant flash-ring array with ECC  
- Time-sync to atomic NTP cascade (fallback to local rubidium)  
- Cryptographically signed per entry (SHA-256 with RSA overlay)

## üß™ Log Analysis Tools

- **DeltaMapper‚Ñ¢**: plots drift patterns over time  
- **HarmonixSweep‚Ñ¢**: correlates fault frequency with external EM sources  
- **FieldEcho‚Ñ¢**: reconstructs beam behavior leading up to collapse  
- **CausalTrace‚Ñ¢**: ranks probable root causes based on historical profile

---

## üß¨ Integration

- Receives events from:
  - `/telemetry_scope_array.md`  
  - `/signal_collapse_recovery.md`  
  - `/gyroscopic_feedback_t1.md`  
- Pushes fault summaries to:
  - `/resonant_field_reinforcement.md`  
  - `/dynamic_resonance_mapper.md`

## üß≤ Future Use

This logbook can be used to **train future harmonic AI tuning systems** or contribute to cross-platform predictive failure analysis.
