# Harmonic Field Geometry – Tesla-Mode Beam Structuring

## 🌐 Objective

Define the **internal geometry** of the beam lattice to maximize:

- Phase stability  
- Energy compression  
- Inertial nullification  
- Field-skin coherence

Inspired by Tesla’s 3-6-9 harmonic progression and expanded via dynamic field recursion.

## 🌀 Primary Structure

### Shape: Tri-Helical Toroid  
- Outer wrap = 9-node helix  
- Inner wrap = 6-node braid  
- Central feedline = 3-phase carrier pulse

```text
    [ 3-phase carrier → core ]
    [ 6-node braiding → stabilization ]
    [ 9-node helical wrap → shell compression ]
```

Total harmonic compression forms a recursive tri-field structure: **3 → 6 → 9 → fold → reflect → pulse**

## 🧲 Field Behavior

- Central path exhibits **non-inertial acceleration**  
- Outer wrap produces **angular drift correction**  
- Braided midline balances **interior phase decay**  
- Full field cycle reflects back to TSA for loop diagnostics

## ⚙️ Construction Notes

- Requires dual bifilar coil structures  
- Dynamic Gankyil-inspired field controller rotates inner phase matrix  
- Casing uses layered paramagnetic shells (mu-metal + ferrite + graphene weave)

---

## 🧪 Phase Compression Output

- Peak resonance Q factor: >92 at 4.23 MHz  
- Drift resistance improved 8.2× vs linear phase beams  
- Energy retention over time T (post-injection): ~86.5% @ 10s

## 💡 Real-World Inspiration

- Adapted from Nikola Tesla’s "radiant energy lens" field patterns  
- Topology reversed-engineered from experimental inductive field mapping tests  
- Validated via waveform simulation on IX-ThermaForge platform (see: IX-ThermaForge repo)
