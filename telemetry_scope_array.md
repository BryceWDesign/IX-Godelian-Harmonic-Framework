# Telemetry Scope Array – Real-Time Curvature Mapping & Field Diagnostics

## 🧭 Purpose

The **Telemetry Scope Array (TSA)** provides direct feedback on the emitted harmonic field, allowing the system to:

- Visualize curvature field behavior in real-time  
- Detect phase anomalies and directional misalignment  
- Calibrate output against environmental interference  
- Provide feedback to T1, GVC, and projection lens subsystems

## 🔬 Sensor Grid Composition

- **Array Shape:** Hemispherical shell (φ: 0–180°, θ: 0–360°)  
- **Sensor Count:** 512–2048 (depending on resolution tier)  
- **Sampling Rate:** 5–20 kHz per node  
- **Types:**  
  - Quantum Hall effect sensors (for flux curvature)  
  - Micro-thermoelectric differentials (for phase energy gradients)  
  - LIDAR rings (for real-world distance mapping)  
  - Aura-field IR overlays (experimental)

## 🔁 Feedback Loop

1. **Capture beam vector F_out(t)** at all array nodes  
2. **Map amplitude, phase, vector angle at each node**  
3. **Construct 3D curvature field map in real time**  
4. **Detect anomalies (phase drift, echo reflections, harmonics)**  
5. **Trigger corrections via T1 or re-map GVC phase input**

## ⚠️ Anomaly Triggers

| Condition                       | Response                                 |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Phase skew > 15°                | Trigger T1 phase rebias                  |
| Vector drift > 2.5°             | Re-align GVC harmonics                   |
| Amplitude jitter > 3σ           | Switch to pulsed mode / re-average input|
| Unexpected field loop feedback  | Log and suspend firing (safety fault)   |

## 🔐 Calibration Modes

- **Auto-Zeroing**: Nulls baseline curvature when beam inactive  
- **Sweep Scan**: Projects test beam and logs delta vs expected  
- **Echo Mode**: Sends back-scatter pulses to test medium interaction

## 🧬 Integration

- Reads output from `/field_projection_lens.md`  
- Sends correction vectors to `/gyroscopic_feedback_t1.md`  
- Reports anomalies to `/signal_collapse_recovery.md`  
- Informs `/dynamic_resonance_mapper.md` for phase path remapping
