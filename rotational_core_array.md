# Subsystem R1 – Rotational Core Array

## 🧠 Purpose

The `R1` subsystem is the energetic heart of the IX-Godelian-Harmonic-Framework.  
It generates and maintains the **harmonically rotated curvature field**, forming the spatial substrate through which Gödelian closed-loop behavior can emerge.

Unlike traditional mechanical gyroscopes, R1 uses **Tesla-style bifilar coils** arranged in a toroidal spiral to create a **field-based rotation geometry** — no moving parts, no fluid, no gravity wells.

---

## 🔄 Core Behavior

R1’s function is to:

1. Produce a **rotating harmonic field**, shaped in a toroidal shell  
2. Lock this rotation to Tesla’s 3-6-9 frequency structure  
3. Maintain field loop closure and spin stability using phase symmetry  
4. Accept feedback inputs from Z1 (energy) and G1 (curve correction)

## 🔋 Signal Profile

R1 generates rotational harmonic fields by:

- Driving bifilar windings with **3-6-9 coded pulses**  
- Using pulse reflection and delayed resonance to emulate angular momentum  
- Creating **torsion-like EM curvature** using standing phase fronts

## 🧮 Core Equations

### Rotational Field Equation

```math
\vec{F}_{rot}(t) = \sum_{n=3,6,9} \alpha_n \cdot \cos(n\omega t + \phi_n) \cdot \hat{\theta}
```

Where:
- \( \alpha_n \) = amplitude of nth harmonic
- \( \omega \) = base frequency (e.g., 3 Hz fundamental)
- \( \phi_n \) = harmonic phase offset
- \( \hat{\theta} \) = unit vector around the toroidal path (azimuthal)

---

## 🏗️ Physical Design

- **Coil form**: Torus ~1.2m outer diameter, 0.2m minor radius  
- **Wire gauge**: 12–14 AWG copper bifilar windings, ceramic-coated  
- **Spacing**: Controlled via resin-infused glass separators  
- **Harmonic drive**: FPGA-controlled waveform output (3 base channels + master sync)  
- **Enclosure**: Inner Faraday barrier + outer ceramic field reflector

## 🔁 Control Inputs

| Source | Purpose                      |
|--------|------------------------------|
| G1     | Field geometry steering       |
| T1     | Phase integrity feedback      |
| Z1     | Injected energy pulse buffer  |

Each signal is handled in **parallel**, passed through a harmonic synchronizer to maintain waveform coherence.

## 🧪 Operational Notes

- R1 operates in field mode only — **no mechanical rotation is present**
- Pulse patterns must maintain strict timing discipline across all nodes
- Each coil segment is individually tunable for micro-phase correction
- Optional: Introduce cryo-jacket cooling to increase Q-factor and reduce inductive loss

---

## 🧱 Real-World Build Notes

- Core frame: PTFE or ceramic for dielectric isolation  
- Coil winding: Manually aligned bifilar windings; directionally matched in triads  
- Phase synchronizer: PLL or FPGA with nanosecond timing resolution  
- Resonant delay loops: Each quadrant can house micro-tuned phase lag capacitors
